#Group Video calling Application


The video application has integrated group chat features which allow users to both watch videos and engage in group chat discussions simultaneously.
Users can create their own chat rooms, join existing ones, and customize their display name and the name of the room they're in. 
This setup allows for a more interactive viewing experience where users can discuss the content they're watching in real time with others.
